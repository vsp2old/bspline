How to use BSPLINE library

1. install

cd v3
cmake .
make
make install
cd ..
ruby extconf.rb --with-BSPLINE-dir=V3
make
make site-install

2. usage in ruby script file

require 'bspline'
include BSPLINE

obj = Bspline.new(..)
..

3. class

Module 'BSPLINE' has 3 classes.

  3.1 Basic interpolation without boundary condition
  
BSPLINE::Bspline.new([[x1,y1],..,[xn,yn]], j)

  3.2 Interpolation with boundary condition by additional data points

BSPLINE::Bspline.new([[x1,y1],..,[xn,yn]], j, [[xn+1,yn+1],..,[xn+d,yn+d]])

  3.3 Interpolation with boundary condition by differential value

BSPLINE::Bspline.new([[x1,y1],..,[xn,yn]], j, [[xn+1,yn+1],..,[xn+d,yn+d]], [b1,..,bd])

  3.4 Interpolation with period boundary condition

BSPLINE::Tspline.new([[x0,y0],..,[xn,yn]], j)

  3.5 Interpolation of smoothing spline

BSPLINE::Gspline.new([[x0,y0],..,[xn,yn]], j, g)

4. Calculate interporation

  4.1 Calculate interpolation
  
	self[x]	#=> y
	self[x1,...,xi] #=> [y1,...yi]

  4.2 Calculate interpolation with differential value
  
    self.value(x, b = 0)

  4.3 Calculate interpolation with integrated value
  
    self.sekibun(x)

  4.4 calculate an interpolation for graphs
  
    self.plot([x0,...,xn], d, b = 0) { |x,y| ... }
